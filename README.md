# MUBench : A Benchmark for API-Misuse Detectors

The MUBench dataset is an [MSR 2016 Data Showcase](http://2016.msrconf.org/#/data). Please feel free to [contact Sven Amann](http://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/staff/sven_amann), if you have any questions.

## Run MUBench

### Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Java 8
* git 2.x
* svn 1.8+

(Other version might work, but where not tested)

### Setup

1. [Download PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML) to somewhere on your machine.
2. Unzip the package and install with `python setup.py install`.
3. Run `scripts/verify.py` to check correct setup.

### Scripts

Run any of the scripts in `scripts`. See script headers for details.

### Benchmark

MUBench is a benchmark for API-misuse detectors. Run `python benchmark.py -h` for details about how to benchmark detectors.

MUBench uses the misuses specified in the `data` subfolder. The first time a misuse is used in benchmarking, the repository containing that misuse is cloned. Subsequently, the existing clone is used, such that benchmarking runs offline.

## Benchmark Your Detector

To benchmark your own detector the following steps are necessary:   

1. Create a new subfolder `my-detector` in the [detectors](https://github.com/stg-tud/MUBench/tree/master/detectors) folder. `my-detector` will be the Id used to refer to your detector when running the benchmark.
2. Add an executable JAR with your detector as `my-detector/my-detector.jar`. When running MUBench, this JAR will be invoked with the arguments and is expected to write the outputs described below.
3. Run MUBench
4. Manually review the results.

*Which Inputs Will I Get?*

To parse the input, you may use `mubench.cli`. You may use the Maven dependency:
```
<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>de.tu-darmstadt.stg</groupId>
			<artifactId>mubench.cli</artifactId>
			<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>
</dependencies>
```
The dependency is not yet hosted in a public Maven repository. For the time being, you have to build it yourself. You find the project [in this repository](https://github.com/stg-tud/MUBench/tree/master/benchmark/mubench.cli).

Using `de.tu_darmstadt.stg.mubench.cli.ArgParser.parse(String[] args)` you will get an instance of `de.tu_darmstadt.stg.mubench.cli.DetectorArgs`. Always check arguments for null since some arguments may be optional.

- DetectorArgs.findingsFile: The file MUBench expects you to write your findings to. This file is `results/<detector>/<misuse>/findings.yml`.
- DetectorArgs.projectSrcPath: The path to the project sources containing the misuse. You may use this to mine usage patterns and find misuses.
- DetectorArgs.projectClassPath: (Optional) The path to the compiled project classes containing the misuse. You may use this like `DetectorArgs.projectSrcPath` if your mining runs on compiled code.
- DetectorArgs.patternsSrcPath: (Optional) The path to pattern files, which contain the fixed version of the usage MUBench expects your detector to find in the project. The files contain Java Source Code snippets. For examples, see the `pattern` folders in [`data`](https://github.com/stg-tud/MUBench/tree/master/data).
- DetectorArgs.patternsClassPath: (Optional) The path to the compiled pattern files. You may use this like `DetectorArgs.patternsSrcPath` if your mining runs on compiled code.

*What Should My Output File Look Like?*

MUBench expects you findings in the [YAML](http://yaml.org/) format. The benchmark reads the two keys `file` (the path to a file your detector found a misuse in) and `graph` (a DOT graph describing the misuse your detector found in that file). You can provide both or only one of the keys per finding. Providing a DOT graph helps MUBench filter false positives and, thereby, reduce the review effort you have to invest later.

Example output file:
```
file: commons/proper/lang/trunk/src/java/org/apache/commons/lang/text/StrBuilder.java
graph: >
	digraph {
	  0 [label="StrBuilder#this#getNullText"]
	  1 [label="String#str#length"]
	  0 -> 1
	}
---
file: src/com/google/javascript/rhino/jstype/UnionType.java
graph: >
	digraph {
	  0 [label="UnionTypeBuilder#builder#build"]
	  1 [label="IF#IF#CONTROL"]
	  0 -> 1
	}
```

## Contribute

To contribute to MUBench, simply use our meta-data template below to describe the API misuse you discovered and [create a new file in the `data` folder](https://github.com/stg-tud/MUBench/new/master/data) named `<project>.<issue>.yml`, where <project> must be unique for the repository. You can also create a file locally and submit it via GitHub's drag&drop feature or fork this repository and send a pull request after you committed new misuses.

To make it even easier, you can also simply [fill our online survey](http://goo.gl/forms/3hua7LOFVJ) to submit your finding.
