# Detector: JADET

For further information, please refer to https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/models/jadet/.

The original detector was extended by a runner that reads MUBench input and writes MUBench output. Furthermore, this runner takes a provided usage as the ground truth to find missing calls, instead of using the majority rule.
